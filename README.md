# Introduction
Hello! I am Katarzyna Motyl, aka Kasia Penta (for artistic purposes).
I write music, and I write music software to some kind as well.

# Where can you listen to my music?  
Well, first of all here: <https://www.youtube.com/@KasiaPenta>  
I have released an album at various streaming services, like Spotify: <https://open.spotify.com/album/3jhmexhIWxa3FisUJleJO9>  
Either way, you can download MP3s, if you feel so (Labels and streaming services are not going to pay money, lol): <https://github.com/kasia-ea/kasia-ea.github.io/tree/main/TUL%20Forschung%201>
